# Okta Factor Demo

## Description

Okta MFA Everywhere is a sample application that uses newer features of Okta to perform
a Multifactor Authentication flow to a Specific Application. Sometimes Customers of Okta
use their own Identity System to perform Primary Authentiation, but they want to add
Multifactor to an in-house built application, and leverage Okta Sign-on Policy to a
specific application.

## Benefits

The benefit of this approach is that the Multifactor Authentication Step can be performed
entirely from the Browser, and **no Server Side code** is required and no **Okta API KEY** is needed.
